# Penguinbrewer
The colornames in R-Colorbrewer are unintuitive and not self-explanatory. This shiny app shows how the colors of the graphs might look, by using the dataset "palmerpenguins".
We have 3 different Shiny Apps, that use:

1. ColorBrewer colors
2. Viridis colors
3. The Wes Anderson colors

and also have the code that generates the graphics in an additional tab.
