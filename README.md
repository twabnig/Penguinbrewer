# Penguinbrewer
The colornames in R-Colorbrewer are unintuitive and not self-explanatory. This shiny app shows how the colors of the graphs might look, by using the dataset "palmerpenguins".
We have 4 different Shiny Apps, that use:

1. ColorBrewer colors
2. Viridis colors
3. The Wes Anderson colors
4. My own palettes from: movies (Star Wars Andor, Melancholia, Clockwork Orange); album covers (Mastodon, Switchfoot, Iron Maiden, Bad Religion, Mark Knopfler); and landscape photography; also includes Cividis and Viridis; some palettes similar to Sigmaplot (e.g. Firehouse); but also the official colors of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (i.e. the department colors)).

and also have the code that generates the graphics in an additional tab.
